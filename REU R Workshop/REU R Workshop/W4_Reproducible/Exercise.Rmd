## Ebola

I'm reading in ebola data from the PLoS paper. Then I will summarize it and possibly make some figures. The figures include:
    
    1. time series plot
    2. distribution of cases per day for each country
    
```{r citing setup, echo=F}    
library(knitcitations)
cleanbib()
options("citation_format" = "pandoc")
```

The citation for the data is here: `r citet('http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002056')` 

```{r ebola, tidy=TRUE}
ebola <- read.csv('http://tinyurl.com/qhrmkht')
plot(value~Date, col=ifelse(Country=="Guinea",1,2), data=ebola)
max(ebola$value)
summary(ebola$value)
```

Here's some more information. 

Mean: `r mean(ebola$value)` 

Standard Deviation: `r sd(ebola$value)` 

Variance: `r var(ebola$value)` 

## Data Questions

1. What does the data represent?
This data represents cumulative Ebola virus cases in Guinea from 2014-2015.

2. What is included in the data set?
There is a combination of probable, suspected, and confirmed Ebola cases and deaths from
the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak. The cases are broken down by country and the most 
recent counts along with the dates. 

3. What have I included?
I have included the max value of ebola counts, as well as some summary statistics on the Ebola counts. 

## Peanut Butter Figure Time! (That was a lame joke)

Let's do some coding things for figures and whatnot. 

```{r plotting things, echo=T, fig.width=6.0, fig.height=4.0}
require(deSolve)
ClosedSIR <- function(t, y, params) {
  S <- y["S"]; I <- y["I"]; R<-y["R"]; N <- S+I+R
  beta <- params["beta"]; gamma <- params["gamma"]
  dS <- -beta*I/N*S
  dI <- beta*I/N*S - gamma*I
  dR <- gamma*I
  return(list(c(dS, dI, dR)))
}
t.vec <- seq(0, 120, 0.1)
beta <- 0.3; gamma <- 1/7
params <- c(beta = beta, gamma = gamma)
N <- 10000
I0 <- 1/N
S0 <- 9999/N
R0 <- 0/N
y0 <- c(S=S0, I=I0, R=R0)

SIRoutput <- lsoda(y0, t.vec, ClosedSIR, params)
SIRoutput <- as.data.frame(SIRoutput)
plot(S~time, data=SIRoutput, type='b', col='red', ylim=c(0,1), ylab="Proportion", xlab='Time')
lines(I~time, data=SIRoutput, type='b', col = 'blue')
lines(R~time, data=SIRoutput, type='b', col='green')
```

The example above shows how to make a simple closed SIR model. Feel free to mess with the parameters to see how it affects the model! Pretty cool stuff(at least that's what they tell me!)
