##First steps

>Step 1: Install R studio

>Step 2: Need to download the rmarkdown, knitr and pander packages -- these are specific to the rmarkdown document making magic

##Creating the rmarkdown script

>1. Open R studio
>2. File --> New File --> R markdown --> Create *file name* and choose the *type* of Document HTML, PDF, and MS Word)

>3. The default anatomy of the document is created.

>4. At the top of the document in the head you can make specifications, these will not all appear in the pdf (like in latex)

>5. When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

>6. As you build the document,  you can **Knit** for previews

##Headings ranked by importance

#This is the largest heading
##This is the second largest heading: you would type "/##Your next subheader"
###This is the third largest heading: you would type "/###Your next subheader"
####This is the fourth largest heading: you would type "/####Smaller"
#####This is the fifth largest heading: you would type "/#####Even smaller"
######This is the sixth largest heading: you would type "/######You totally get this pattern"


##Ways to get different text formats

1. For numbered lists you would write "1. The list thing" (no tab in front, but you DO need a space between the period and the text)
    * For a sub-section of the list, you would write "*tab* + The list thing", with a tab in front and a space between the plus (- or + also works in place of the \*)

* For bulleted lists, you can use \*, -, or + in (\* your thing)
    * For a sub-bullet, you'd use "*tab* - the thing"
     
   

For *italics*, you can do \*italics\* or \_italics\_. For **bold**, you can do \**bold\** or \__bold\__. 

##Links

To do [links](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) you type "[the text] (the URL)" with no space in between.


##Quotes
Let's quote some stuff:

> “Mathematics without natural history is sterile, but natural history without mathematics is muddled.”
> _John Maynard Smith_

##Footnotes
This is regular text^[with a footnote].

##Formulas and equations

**Example 1**: This summation expression $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ appears inline. This equation is also inline $E=mc^2$

**Example 2**:This summation expression is in display form.

$$\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$

**Example 3**: $$f(x, \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

**Example 4**: Numbering the equations

(@cauchy) $f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi(1+x^2)}$ 

The Cauchy distribution (with density given in Eq. (@cauchy)) is a special case 
of Student's $t$-distribution (Eq. (@tdist)) with $\nu = 1$.

(@tdist) $$f(t; \nu) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{\nu+1}{2})} {\sqrt{\nu\pi}\,\Gamma(\frac{\nu}{2})} \left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu} \right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}$$

\newpage

**Example 5**:
<div class="equation">
(@gamma) $$\Gamma(t) = \int^\infty_0 x^{t-1}e^{-x}dx$$
</div>


**Example 6**:
<div id="volterra" class="equation">
(@volterra) $$\frac{dS}{dt} = x(\alpha - \beta y)$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = - y(\gamma - \delta  x)$$
</div>

The system of ordinary differential equations given by 
Eq. <span id="volterra" class="eq_ref">(@volterra)</span> 
is commonly used to describe predator-prey systems. Any solution to this
system of equations satisfies the equality in 
Eq. <span id="volterra_constant" class="eq_ref">(@volterra_constant)</span>.

<div id="volterra_constant" class="equation">
(@volterra_constant) $$V = -\delta \, x + \gamma \, \log(x) - \beta \, y + \alpha \, \log(y)$$
</div>


##Subscripts and superscripts

**Example 1**: $$X_i$$
**Example 2**: $$X_{i}$$
**Example 3**: $$X^2_{i,j}$$
**Example 4**: To do^superscripts^ in text  you can also use type\^superscript\^.

##Square roots

**Example**: $$\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$$

##Fractions

**Example**: $$\frac{4z^3}{16}$$

##Summation expressions

**Example**: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} X^3_i$$

##Parenthesis

**Example**: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left( \frac{X_i}{Y_i} \right)$$





##Greek Letters

**Example**: $$\alpha, \beta,  \gamma, \Gamma$$

##Special Symbols

**Example 1**: $$a \pm b$$
**Example 2**: $$x \ge 15$$
**Example 3**: $$a_i \ge 0~~~\forall i$$

##Integrals and other functions
**Example**: $$\int_0^{2\pi} \sin x~dx$$

##Matrices

**Example**: $$\mathbf{X} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{array}\right]
$$

##Making your code easily reproducible by your collaborators

##Chunks of code 

If in the middle of our text we need to do analysis or plots, we can insert _R_ code can easily using what we called "chunks" of code. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

##Analysis
```{r loading libraries, comment=""  }
set.seed(1234)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(MASS)
test=rnorm(10000, 1,0.1)
```


\newpage

##Figures

By default there are no captions, if you dont specify dimensions it will plot default measures, if you don't want all code to be shown you need to add the follwing {r echo = FALSE}.


```{r histogram, eval=TRUE, comment=""}
hist(test, col='dodgerblue2', las=1, breaks=200, main='')
box()
```


\newpage


### Control code chunks, figure size and adding captions
The following is an example of a smaller figure using `fig.width` and `fig.height` options. It also has fig.cap for captions.
Note the {r echo=FALSE} to conceal the code chunks.

```{r ,fig.width=4,fig.height=4,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,include=TRUE,fig.cap="This figure will blow your mind"}
library(ggplot2)
plotData <- data.frame(x = rnorm(1000, 1, 5), y = rnorm(1000, 0, 2))
plotKeep <- ggplot(plotData, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(colour="red", alpha=0.2)+theme_bw()
plotKeep
```

\newpage

###Inserting pre generated figures or images

You can also insert jpeg, pdf or png files

\newpage


###Generating multi figures 

Like with any RScript, the use of par(mfrow=c(#,#)) will aloow you to generate multiple plots as a group.
I have wrote a small loop here to allow for labelling of each subplot

```{r, bunch_o_figs_pointsize, fig.height=4, fig.width=8,echo=FALSE,include=TRUE, dev.args=list(pointsize=12)}
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
par(mfrow=c(1,2), las=1)
for(i in 1:4) {
  y <- i*x + rnorm(n)
  plot(x, y, main=i, cex.main= 0.8, cex.lab= 1.2)
 
}
```
Figure 3: Multiple plots (1-4)


\newpage

##Tables

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r kable, echo=FALSE}
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(n)
out <- lm(y ~ x)
library(knitr)
kable(summary(out)$coef, digits=2,caption = 'Producing an output model as a table')
```

```{r xtable, results='asis', echo= FALSE}
library(knitr)
Region1<-rep(c("East Midlands","Eastern"), each = 2)
City<-c("Lincoln","Nottingham","Bedford","Norwich")
Cities<-cbind(Region1, City)
colnames(Cities)<-c("Region","City")
kable(Cities,caption = 'Custom table')
```


##Using references: what you need

1. A *bib* file with your library or references. 
2. A *cls* file that will indicate the journal style for the references. In this [zotero link](https://www.zotero.org/styles) you can find hundreds of styles in *cls* format, that you need to define at the beggining of the rmarkdown document (above I'm using *plos-biology*)

**Example**: A study has shown blah [@Adams1947].  Campbell [-@Campbell2012] has show blah.


##Spaces

Forcing spaces between figures or paragraphs with ("& nbsp;" with no spaces) or leaving a line blank between paragraphs.

Navideh likes frozen yoghurt.

Toby loves bananas.

Diego has a chia seeds' plantation.


##Page breaks
Like in latex the command “forward slash newpage” will allow you to force a page break



\newpage

##Packages used, so your collaborators know what you used

```{r, echo_session_info, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
  toLatex(sessionInfo())
```
