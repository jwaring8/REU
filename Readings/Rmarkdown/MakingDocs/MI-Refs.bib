abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of maternally derived antibody on the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of acellular (DTaP) or whole-cell (DTP) pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids combined. METHODS: A total of 2342 infants were randomized to receive one of 13 DTaP or 2 DTP vaccines at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The correlation between preimmunization and postimmunization antibody after three doses of vaccine and the relation between preimmunization antibody and adverse reactions after the first immunization were modeled by linear regression. RESULTS: After DTP but not DTaP, higher levels of preexisting antibody were associated with substantial (28{\%} to 56{\%}) reductions in the subsequent antibody response to pertussis toxin (PT). For other pertussis antibodies, modest inverse correlations were seen between preexisting antibody concentrations and most postimmunization antibody responses (resulting in 8{\%} to 18{\%} reductions in postimmunization antibody) for both DTP and DTaP. There was no consistent association in any DTP or DTaP group between adverse reactions and preimmunization antibody levels. CONCLUSION: The PT antibody response to DTaP, unlike DTP, is not adversely affected by preexisting antibody to PT. Inhibitory effects with respect to other antibodies, seen with both DTP and DTaP, were relatively modest. Our data suggest that the use of acellular pertussis vaccines in adults, which could confer higher levels of antibody in women before pregnancy, would be unlikely to adversely affect pertussis antibody responses after DTaP among infants born to mothers with high antibody levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pertussis booster vaccine (Tdap) recommendations assume that pertussis-specific antibodies in women immunized preconception, during, or after previous pregnancies persist at sufficient levels to protect newborn infants. METHODS: Pertussis-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) was measured by IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in maternal-umbilical cord serum pairs where mothers received Tdap during the prior 2 years. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of pertussis antibodies and cord-maternal GMC ratios were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred five mothers (mean age, 25.3 years [range, 15.3-38.4 years]; mean gestation, 39 weeks [range, 37-43 weeks]) immunized with Tdap vaccine a mean of 13.7 months (range, 2.3-23.9 months) previously were included; 72 (69{\%}) had received Tdap postpartum, 31 at a routine healthcare visit and 2 as contacts of another newborn. There was no difference in GMCs for pertussis-specific IgG in maternal delivery or infant cord sera for women immunized before (n = 86) or during (n = 19) early pregnancy. Placental transport of antibodies was 121{\%}-186{\%} from mothers immunized before and during pregnancy, respectively. Estimated GMC of IgG to pertussis toxin was <5 ELISA units (EU)/mL at infant age 2 months (start of infant immunization series). More infants of mothers immunized during pregnancy had pertussis toxin levels estimated to be higher than the lower limit of quantitation of the assay (4 EU/mL) through age 2 months (52{\%} vs 38{\%}; P = .34). CONCLUSIONS: Infants of mothers immunized preconception or in early pregnancy have insufficient pertussis-specific antibodies to protect against infection. Maternal immunization during the third trimester, immunization of other infant contacts, and reimmunization during subsequent pregnancies may be necessary.},

abstract = {Pertussis remains a serious infection in young infants. Most deaths occur in the first 3 months of life, before administration of the first dose of pertussis vaccine. Pertussis antibodies are transferred from mother to infant; but because of the lack of serologic correlates of protection, it is difficult to determine the proportion of infants born with a protective concentration of maternal antibodies. Indirect evidence suggests that maternal antibodies provide short lived protection against fatal pertussis. It is hoped that the protection of young infants could be enhanced by maternal or neonatal vaccination. The possibility of protecting young infants against pertussis by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy was investigated in the 1930s and 1940s; no further studies have been published since. Recent animal and human studies have provided evidence that neonatal immunization with acellular pertussis vaccine can efficiently prime T and B cells and act as a basis for future immune response. The limited data on neonatal and maternal pertussis immunization are promising and call for further research to reduce the vulnerability of young infants to pertussis disease.},

STUDY DESIGN: We searched VAERS for reports of pregnant women who received Tdap from Jan. 1, 2005, through June 30, 2010. We conducted a clinical review of reports and available medical records. RESULTS: We identified 132 reports of Tdap administered to pregnant women; 55 (42{\%}) described no adverse event (AE). No maternal or infant deaths were reported. The most frequent pregnancy-specific AE was spontaneous abortion in 22 (16.7{\%}) reports. Injection site reactions were the most frequent non-pregnancy-specific AE found in 6 (4.5{\%}) reports. One report with a major congenital anomaly (gastroschisis) was identified. CONCLUSION: During a time when Tdap was not routinely recommended in pregnancy, review of reports to VAERS in pregnant women after Tdap did not identify any concerning patterns in maternal, infant, or fetal outcomes.},
